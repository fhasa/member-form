task description

Description:
We need to create a form (as seen in the screenshot).
In that form, we will have a list of names of Front-end developers. Each item has a checkbox in which we can choose the list of developers to create a new team.
Requirements:
It starts with unselected items. Items are grey and unchecked.
Clicking on the item will select it (it becomes black and checked)
No JavaScript is needed (No need to make the search functionality work).
Connect it to Formspree and make sure it receives the checked items only.
Cancel, and ESC buttons don't do anything when clicking on them.
All clickable items (Buttons, ESC, developers) should show a hover and a click effects. For example, when you go to Gmail and hover over the Compose button, it will show some shadows and a background color change, and clicking on it will be darker.
You can use Font Awesome library for the icons (Google it and learn how to use it)
Make sure that the form is accessible.
Use a gradient for the Save button background.
If you have time, add an animation when selecting/unselecting an item. It can be fading, zooming in, then out ...etc.
If you have any questions, please reply to this and ask.
